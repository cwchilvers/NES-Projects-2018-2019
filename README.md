## Description
These are a few test projects while learning how to develop games for the NES. From 2018-2020, each summer there was about a week where I decided to try some NES game development (and gave up when I got too frustrated). These projects were written in 6502 assembly and were assembled using [NESasm](https://github.com/camsaul/nesasm). Sprites were created using [YY-CHR](https://shiru.untergrund.net/software.shtml). The games were tested using the [FCEUX](https://fceux.com/web/home.html) emulator.

## Installation
1. To run these projects, you will need to install an NES emulator, such as [FCEUX](https://fceux.com/web/home.html).
2. Download the project files from this repository (click the green "Code" button at the top of the page, then click "Download ZIP").
3. Extract the ZIP file to a folder on your computer.

## Usage
1. Open your NES emulator.
2. Open any `.nes` file found in the `bin` folder of the project to run.
